\section*{Summary}
I am a native English speaker from Australia living in Korea hoping to get some more experience teaching for a few years. \\

I have previously taught English in hagwons, kindergartens, primary schools and junior high schools both following a curriculum and planning my own lessons. At university I tutored and demonstrated for engineering and programming units as well as attending the ``Seminars, Tutorials and Laboratories" teaching course. During my time working and studying at university I published three academic papers, presented two at conferences and got the highest mark in our only unit on communication, writing and giving presentations. \\

In Korea I've just finished working at a hagwon teaching primary school students. Earlier this year I was working at a kindergarten as the homeroom teacher of the six year olds. Here I was their main teacher for teaching, solving disputes and recreation. I've taught English (conversation, reading 
\& grammar), science, art, mathematics and programming. \\

I really enjoy teaching and would like to expand the teaching skills and experience I currently have.
