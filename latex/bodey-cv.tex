	\end{basedescript}
This project required changing the platform of an active damage detection system from large and expensive laboratory equipment to a cheaper and smaller embedded platform that is more applicable to the field. This involved cross-compiling for an embedded platform using OpenEmbedded, user and kernel level code, some circuit design and mathematical analysis of sensor readings.

{\bf Developed Skills:} Cross-compiling; embedded software; kernel level development; linux architecture; C; Python; hardware; OpenEmbedded; SPI; LabVIEW; Networks.
