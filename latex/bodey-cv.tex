\section*{Education}

\subsection*{Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) - The University of Western Australia}
{\bf Thesis:} {\em Developing a stand alone wireless sensor network for damage detection using the impedance method} \newline
This project required changing the platform of an active damage detection system from large and expensive laboratory equipment to a cheaper and smaller embedded platform that is more applicable to the field. This involved cross-compiling for an embedded platform using OpenEmbedded, user and kernel level code, some circuit design and mathematical analysis of sensor readings. \newline
{\bf Skills:} Cross-compiling; embedded software; kernel level development; linux architecture; hardware; SPI. \\

\end{minipage}

\subsection*{Computer Science with Honours - The University of Western Australia} % Honours (2A)
{\bf Thesis:} {\em Strategy specification for teamwork in robot soccer} \newline
Researched planning in multi-agent systems where a team of agents have a common goal, are being hindered by other agents, only have a limited view of the world, and due to time constraints not all team members can be informed of the planned solution but they must still co-ordinate in a reasonable manner. \newline
{\bf Skills:} Algorithms; C{\small ++}; Visual Studio. \\
{\bf GPA (WAM)} 6.00 (74.13) \newline
{\bf Units with high distinction:} Computer Vision, Scientific Communication, Visualisation
