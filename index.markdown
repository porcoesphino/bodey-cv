Building a résumé is tough and tiring but every time I do it I learn a little more and end up writing some notes. Here are some of those notes along with my resume.
</div>

## Examples

* [Kevin Fox's résumé](http://fury.com/resume/kevin_fox_resume.pdf) is beautiful in it's simplicity. If only I had the experience.
* [Abie Rose](http://abierose.com/resume.pdf) has a nice one for a creative job.
* [Alyson Shontell's cover letter](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-application-and-cover-letter-that-got-me-an-interview-with-google-2011-2) for applying at Google.
* [Katie Newell's résumés](http://www.katienewell.com) isn't too much for a technical role, but still nicely designed.
* I obviously read [James Paden's guide](http://www.xemion.com/website-design-learning-center/5-steps-to-the-perfect-web-designer-resume/) while collecting these >_<


*** If you see any other good examples, let me know. ***

Mine is far worse. I'll add links in a second.
