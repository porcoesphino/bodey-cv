## My résumé ##

When it's time to look for a job:

* first it's annoying;
* then you hate talking yourself up;
* then you learn a few skills;
* and finally you notice that some résumés are really quite nice.
*  and then apparently you [make a website][] to host your notes.

My résumé used to be version controlled but then Sugarsync and Dropbox offered internet access. Now it's going to be version controlled again and public. Using Latex to write a résumé probably didn't lead to the easiest implementation and I'd like to share it with others. Over time I plan to slowly port this to HTML/CSS. If they are good enough for beautiful websites and google docs / drive then they should be good enough for my lowly résumés ;)
