## My résumé ##

My résumé used to be version controlled but then Sugarsync and Dropbox offered internet access. Now it's going to be version controlled again and public. Using Latex to write a résumé probably didn't lead to the easiest implementation and I'd like to share it with others. Over time I plan to slowly port this to HTML/CSS. If they are good enough for beautiful websites and google docs / drive then they should be good enough for my lowly résumés ;)

When it's time to look for a job:
* first it's annoying;
* then you hate talking yourself up;
* then you learn a few skills;
* and finally you notice that some résumés are really quite nice.

Here are some nice résumés I've seen around:
* [Kevin Fox's résumé](http://fury.com/resume/kevin_fox_resume.pdf) is beautiful in it's simplicity. If only I had the experience.
* [Abie Rose](http://abierose.com/resume.pdf) has a nice one for a creative job.
* [Alyson Shontell's cover letter](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-application-and-cover-letter-that-got-me-an-interview-with-google-2011-2) for applying at Google.
* [Katie Newell's résumés](http://www.katienewell.com) isn't too much for a technical role, but still nicely designed.
* I obviously read [James Paden's guide](http://www.xemion.com/website-design-learning-center/5-steps-to-the-perfect-web-designer-resume/) while collecting these >_<
* If you see any other good examples, let me know.
