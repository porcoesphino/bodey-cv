# Summary

NOTE: Work in progress

I thought I should be able to make a resume that is generated and tailored to
different jobs. It was more work than I thought but here is the work so far.
It's currently a general resume that will come in more than one format. I'll add filters for different roles later.

I really find that when you are looking for a job:

* first it's annoying;
* then you hate talking yourself up;
* then you learn a few skills;
* and finally you notice that some resumes are really quite nice.

So I've kept a cache of some nice resumes I've seen around:

* [Kevin Fox's resume](http://fury.com/resume/kevin_fox_resume.pdf) is beautiful in it's simplicity. If only I had the experience.
* [Abie Rose](http://abierose.com/resume.pdf) has a nice one for a creative job.
* [Alyson Shontell's cover letter](http://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-the-application-and-cover-letter-that-got-me-an-interview-with-google-2011-2) for applying at Google.
* [Katie Newell's resume](http://www.katienewell.com) isn't too much for a technical role, but still nicely designed.
* I obviously read [James Paden's guide](http://www.xemion.com/website-design-learning-center/5-steps-to-the-perfect-web-designer-resume/) while collecting these >_<
* If you see any other good examples, let me know.

# TODO

- Move to SASS (Bootstrap is moving that way)
- Add other formats then this summary:
  + If you're hiring: Here is my quick to decide resume in HTML.
  + If you're a robot scanning for keywords: Here is my markdown resume.
  + If you like PDFs and Latex: Here is my latex resume.
  + If you hate like plain text and hate reading: Here is my markdown resume.
