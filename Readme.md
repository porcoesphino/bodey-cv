# Summary

NOTE: Work in progress

I thought I should be able to make a resume that is generated and tailored to
different jobs. It was more work than I thought but here is the work so far.
It's currently a general resume that comes in more than one format. I'll add
filters later.

- If you're hiring: Here is my quick to decide cv in HTML.
- If you're a robot scanning for keywords: Here is my markdown cv.
- If you like PDFs and Latex: Here is my latex cv
- If you hate like plain text and hate reading: Here is my markdown resume.

# TODO

- Move to SASS (Bootstrap is moving that way)
