## Experience ##


Mar 2013 - Sep 2013: Kindergarten English Teacher @ Wonderland, Korea

 - Taught English and most subjects, planned classes and was a home room teacher.


Jul 2010 - Jul 2012: Software Engineer @ Cyber Technology, Australia

 - Implemented the ground control manager for controlling and configuring UAVs using JavaScript & PHP to network with the ground control server.
 - Implemented the first version of the ground control manager prototype in Java.
 - Designed and wrote the firmware and boot loaders for our peripheral devices using C and the Code Sourcery toolchain. This required knowledge of UDP, CAN and reverse engineering of third party bus protocols.
 - Prototyped / analysed data in Python and C#


May 2009 - Jun 2010: Undergraduate Engineer @ JRB Engineering, Australia

 - Processed data in Python to ensure vehicles met vibration requirements.
 - Improved the pattern matching algorithm for brake pad detection using Python.
 - Wrote Visual C{\footnotesize \#}  Visualisation software to highlight issues in current  software.
 - Improved Visual C{\footnotesize ++} program to remove noise from point cloud data.


Jan 2008 - Mar 2008: Undergraduate Engineer @ JRB Engineering, Australia

 - Visualised the output of log files using Visual Studio with C++.
 - Created dynamic libraries for data processing routines in Windows
 - Modelled parts for a road rail vehicle using Autodesk Inventor.


Aug 2007 - Jan 2008: Research Assistant @ CET - UWA, Australia

 - Studied the feasibility of using Amira to process 3D data sampled from rock samples to analyse their composite structure and visualise the segmented data using a 3D projector for better data exploration.


Dec 2006 - Dec 2007: Research Assistant @ CET - UWA, Australia

 - Researched an algorithm to analyse the directional variation of roughness of a rock surface from 3D geometric data using MPI for C.
 - Skills Gained: visualisation; parallel computing; algorithm design.
 - Eventuated in a paper.



## Education ##


### Bachelor of Engineering (Mechatronics) - The University of Western Australia ###

Thesis: Developing a stand alone wireless sensor network for damage detection using the impedance method

> This project required changing the platform of an active damage detection system from large and expensive laboratory equipment to a cheaper and smaller embedded platform that is more applicable to the field. This involved cross-compiling for an embedded platform using OpenEmbedded, user and kernel level code, some circuit design and mathematical analysis of sensor readings.

Developed Skills: Cross-compiling; embedded software; kernel level development; linux architecture; hardware; SPI.


### Computer Science with Honours - The University of Western Australia ###

Thesis: Strategy specification for teamwork in robot soccer

> Researched planning in multi-agent systems where a team of agents have a common goal, are being hindered by other agents, only have a limited view of the world, and due to time constraints not all team members can be informed of the planned solution but they must still co-ordinate in a reasonable manner.

Developed Skills: Algorithms; C++; Visual Studio

## Quotations ##

> Bodey worked very hard and long hours during his time at Cyber Technology. He assisted the CyberPilot Project by being innovative and thorough. His ability to plan and develop key process improvements has resulted in outcomes well ahead of expectations and lead times. I would recommend Bodey to anyone seeking a reliable, efficient and well informed engineer and team leader.
